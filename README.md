# Connnect Four
The goal of this project was to build a command line version of Connect Four in Ruby. RSpec was used for testing as part of test-driven development. The grid is the classic 6 x 7 size and a turn is played by dropping a colored token (in this case black or white) into one of the columns.

To play the game, run `$ ruby lib/connect_four.rb` from inside this directory in the terminal.
